# AUTONOMOUS_DRONE_NAVIGATION-SYSTEM
The Autonomous Drone Navigation System is an intelligent, computer-graphics-powered project designed to simulate how drones navigate within predefined airspaces. Using the Cohen–Sutherland Algorithm, the system demonstrates how drones avoid restricted zones, calculate safe flight paths, and make real-time decisions when encountering obstacles.
